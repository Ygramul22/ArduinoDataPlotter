# Arduino Data Plotter
Simple c# visual studio application to read the numeric values printed by an arduino via serial port and convert them to graphs and more.
*For in-depth look of the serial port communication* check the folder _RadioSystem_ in VisualStudioApp/Pelayitos_2
The code data printed in the console by the arduino should resemble the Packet class structure.
Please note this was all made within Visual Studio 2022.
